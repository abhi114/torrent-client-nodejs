Let's break down how the group function works with an example.

group Function
Here's the group function again:

javascript

function group(iterable, groupSize) {
  let groups = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < iterable.length; i += groupSize) {
    groups.push(iterable.slice(i, i + groupSize));
  }
  return groups;
}
Explanation
iterable: This is the input array or buffer that you want to divide into smaller groups.
groupSize: The size of each group.
The function iterates through the iterable, creating slices of length groupSize and adding them to the groups array.

Example
Let's say we have the following buffer (array of 12 bytes) that represents 2 peers, where each peer's data takes 6 bytes:

javascript

const buffer = [
  0xC0, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x50, // Peer 1: IP (192.168.0.1), Port (80)
  0xC0, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x02, 0x01, 0xBB  // Peer 2: IP (192.168.0.2), Port (443)
];
In this case, iterable = buffer and groupSize = 6.

Step-by-Step Execution:
Initially, groups = [].
The first iteration:
i = 0
iterable.slice(0, 6) returns the first 6 bytes: [0xC0, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x50]
This represents the first peer.
Add it to groups:
groups = [[0xC0, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x50]]
The second iteration:
i = 6
iterable.slice(6, 12) returns the next 6 bytes: [0xC0, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x02, 0x01, 0xBB]
This represents the second peer.
Add it to groups:
groups = [[0xC0, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x50], [0xC0, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x02, 0x01, 0xBB]]
Final Result:
javascript
Copy code
[
  [0xC0, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x50], // Peer 1
  [0xC0, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x02, 0x01, 0xBB]  // Peer 2
]
How It Works with map
Now that the peers are grouped into arrays of 6 bytes each, the map function processes each group to convert it into an object with the ip and port:

For the first peer:

address.slice(0, 4) gives [0xC0, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x01] → '192.168.0.1'
address.readUInt16BE(4) reads the next two bytes [0x00, 0x50] → 80
Result: { ip: '192.168.0.1', port: 80 }
For the second peer:

address.slice(0, 4) gives [0xC0, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x02] → '192.168.0.2'
address.readUInt16BE(4) reads the next two bytes [0x01, 0xBB] → 443
Result: { ip: '192.168.0.2', port: 443 }
So after mapping, you get:



[
  { ip: '192.168.0.1', port: 80 },
  { ip: '192.168.0.2', port: 443 }
]
