3.1 Http vs udp vs tcp
The main reason that most trackers now use udp is that udp has better performance than 
http. Http is built on top of another protocol called tcp, which we’ll use later in the project when we start actually downloading files from peers. So what’s the difference between tcp and udp?

The main difference is that tcp guarantees that when a user sends data, 
the other user will recieve that data in its entirety, uncorrupted, and in the correct order – but it must create a persistent connection between users before sending data and this can make tcp much slower than udp. In the case of upd, if the data being sent is small enough (less than 512 bytes) you don’t have to worry about receiving only part of the data or receiving data out of order. However, as we’ll see shortly, it’s possible that data sent will never reach its destination, and so you sometimes end up having to resend or re-request data.

For these reasons, udp is often a good choice for trackers because they send small messages, 
and we use tcp for when we actually transfer files between peers because those files tend to be larger and must arrive intact.
